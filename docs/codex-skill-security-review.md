# Codex Skill security review

Reviewed 2026-07-12 before installation. Repository revisions were obtained with read-only `git clone` into an isolated temporary directory; no third-party installer, hook, or repository script was executed during review.

## nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill

- Source: `https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill`
- Reviewed component: `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max` (about 1.5 MB), not the npm CLI or other bundled plugins.
- Installed component contains `SKILL.md`, CSV reference data, and three Python scripts using standard-library modules. Search reads only bundled CSV files and writes only when `--persist` is explicitly requested, to the selected output directory.
- No subprocess, shell execution, package install, network request, credential access, install hook, or active Git hook was found in the installed component.
- The upstream CLI was not installed or run. It has npm dependencies and a `prepublishOnly` chain, so it remains outside the trusted project surface.
- Prompt review found no instruction to override higher-priority rules, expose secrets, or silently execute/download content. Project instructions explicitly take precedence over aesthetic recommendations.
- License: MIT. A copy is retained with the installed Skill because the upstream Skill subdirectory does not contain its own license file.
- Residual risk: CSV guidance is third-party content and can be inaccurate; scripts can create design-system Markdown only when invoked with persistence. Review generated recommendations and diffs before use.

## anthropics/skills `.claude-plugin`

- Source: `https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/.claude-plugin`
- The target is a marketplace manifest, not one Skill. It references document, example, and Claude API Skill collections.
- The potentially relevant `skills/frontend-design` contains only `SKILL.md` and Apache-2.0 license text, with no scripts, hooks, dependencies, network access, or file/command permissions.
- Other marketplace entries contain scripts that may use subprocesses, package managers, browsers, or network examples. They were not installed because they are unrelated to PastExamWeb_PHY and an all-or-nothing install would unnecessarily widen capability and supply-chain surface.
- `frontend-design` was not copied because its default emphasis on inventing a distinctive visual identity can conflict with this established application's consistency-first requirement. Its useful accessibility, responsive, reduced-motion, purposeful-content, and self-review concepts are represented independently in the project Skill.

## Installed and project-owned Skills

- `.codex/skills/ui-ux-pro-max`: reviewed third-party UI/UX reference Skill; advisory only.
- `.codex/skills/pastexam-web`: project-owned workflow Skill covering architecture discovery, frontend consistency, backend/API/database changes, risk-based validation, browser retry limits, and Git workflow.
